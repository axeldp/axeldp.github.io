(https://img.shields.io/badge/.pdf-Download%20here!-blue)

This study encompasses published research to date on how green roofs can help mitigate pollution and quantifies the level of air pollution removal of extensive green roofs in two possible future scenarios in the Barcelona urban center. The focus was laid down on pollutants with health-threatening levels during the year 2020. A dry deposition model like the i-Tree Eco software was used to estimate how much pollution can be absorbed. This research suggests green roofs have the potential to play a key role in the development of sustainable cities, and as a result, they should be widely employed and promoted as instruments in urban planning and policies towards a climate friendly future.

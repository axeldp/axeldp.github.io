## Demand Forecasting with Machine Learning: ***Predicting NYC CitiBike montlhy trips with IBM AutoAI (Watson Studio)***
Demand forecasting is critical to businesses and institutions because it utlimately defines profitability and accurate future scenarios. The integration of the IBM ML model for this project followed this process:

## BTC/EUR Trading Strategy: ***Demo Account Data Analysis over 30 Days***
I decided to set up a 10.000€ demo account in Binance and test a trading strategy for the 1 minute Bitcoin Chart. The data was gathered and calculated on Google Sheets. The startegy was based on the following algorithm (always counting a 1.5 risk/benefit Ratio). 

In order to place a long position, following condition should be met: 
1. BTC Price + 20MA Indicator > 200MA Indicator 
2. Stochastic RSI CrossUp Event under the 20% Zone 
3. 2x Green Supertrend Indicators

In order to place a short position, following condition should be met: 
1. BTC Price + 20MA Indicator < 200MA Indicator 
2. Stochastic RSI CrossDown Event over the 80% Zone 
3. 2x Red Supertrend Indicators

## URL Refresher: ***Python script reloading every minute a specific URL***
During my period at Innovation Group, our team live production was broadcasted in 2 different TVs during the working hours. The main problem was that someone had to refresh the website every time we wanted to see updated data. As an IT assistant I came up with the idea of creating a python script to automated the process of opening the url, loging in and reloading the website.

## Bachelor Thesis: ***Extensive green roofs as an air pollution abatement strategy in Barcelona***

This study encompasses published research to date on how green roofs can help mitigate pollution and quantifies the level of air pollution removal of extensive green roofs in two possible future scenarios in the Barcelona urban center. The focus was laid down on pollutants with health-threatening levels during the year 2020. A dry deposition model like the i-Tree Eco software was used to estimate how much pollution can be absorbed. This research suggests green roofs have the potential to play a key role in the development of sustainable cities, and as a result, they should be widely employed and promoted as instruments in urban planning and policies towards a climate friendly future.
